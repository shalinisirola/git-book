# Linux Fundamentals

## Linux

Linux is an operating system, just like Windows, macOS, iOS, or Android.

An operating system (OS) is a software that manages all the hardware resources of a computer, facilitating communication between software applications and hardware components.

Linux is generally considered more secure than other operating systems, and while it has had many kernel vulnerabilities in the past, it is becoming less and less frequent. It is less susceptible to malware than Windows operating systems and is very frequently updated.

Linux is also very stable and generally affords very high performance to the end-user. However, it can be more difficult for beginners and does not have as many hardware drivers as Windows.

Linux is free and open-source, the source code can be modified and distributed commercially or non-commercially by anyone.
